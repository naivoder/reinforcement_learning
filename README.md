This repository contains Python implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms, each designed to tackle a range of different environments and problems. These implementations serve as a practical introduction to the field of reinforcement learning and are suitable for educational purposes, research, and development of more complex algorithms.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need Python 3.7 or later. It is also recommended to set up a virtual environment.

## Installation

To get started with these implementations, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/reinforcement_learning.git
cd reinforcement_learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each algorithm's folder contains a separate README with detailed instructions on how to run the implementations. Generally, you can run each Python script directly from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

There are also Jupyter notebooks included.
