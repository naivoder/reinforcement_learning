# Lunar Lander Policy Gradient

The this repository contains an implementation of the Policy Gradient reinforcement learning method, specifically designed for the Lunar Lander game provided by OpenAI's Gym environment. This project uses a neural network to estimate policy directly from the state of the lander, allowing the agent to learn optimal actions to land the spaceship safely between two flags on the surface of the moon. The agent is trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes the policy by updating it in the direction that maximizes expected returns.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need to install Python and several dependencies, including PyTorch and Gymnasium.

## Usage

To train and test the agent on the Lunar Lander game using the Policy Gradient method, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
